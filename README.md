Bearwall is a firewall builder that allows you to easily manage complex
security policy on a linux host by separating your policies into reusable
classes and rulesets.

Bearwall reads in your firewall policy, defined in Bash, and generates the
appropriate nftables chains and rules to implement consistent policy for a
dual-stacked host.
